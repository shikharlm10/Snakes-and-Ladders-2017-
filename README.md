# Snakes-and-Ladders-2017-
My first game using C++ +graphics in turbo C

Showed this as my 12th class project in 2017.

Simple game ,out of 100, certain boxes where there are snakes and ladders.
If you land on ladders, you climb up to the box it ends.
If you land on snakes , you go back to where the snake's tails ends.
whoever lands  on 100 first , wins the game.

NOTE:There is still some unresolved issues regarding player turn, the dice showing the result and then the puck moving.
Have to press enter 3 times before 1 turn  registers.
Rest is working nOice!
